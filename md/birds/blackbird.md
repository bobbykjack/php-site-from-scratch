# Blackbird

The common blackbird (Turdus merula) is a species of true thrush. It is also
called the Eurasian blackbird (especially in North America, to distinguish it
from the unrelated New World blackbirds), or simply the blackbird where this
does not lead to confusion with a similar-looking local species. It breeds in
Europe, Asiatic Russia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to Australia
and New Zealand. It has a number of subspecies across its large range; a few of
the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered to be full species. Depending on
latitude, the common blackbird may be resident, partially migratory, or fully
migratory.
